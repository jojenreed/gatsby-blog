I'll give it to you straight.

This blog will serve as the public log of my learning journey.

The idea is far from original. [Viral post from Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/ "Learn in public")

###Step 1: Take responsibility for your education.

Most people tend to mistake education for the time that they spent in school.
Recognise that it is a process, and like all processes, it can be hacked.

###Step 2: Set ambitious goals for yourself.

The template goal sheet that your manager sends you and 20 others at the end of the financial year is not good enough.

###Step 3: The standard pace is for chumps.

The systems you see around you are designed so that anyone can keep up. Read that again, the systems you find comfort in are designed for the lowest common denominator. Don't be a chump.
