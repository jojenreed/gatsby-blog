I'll give it to you straight.

This blog will serve as the public log of my learning journey.

The idea is far from original. [Viral post from Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/ "Learn in public")

###Step 1: Take responsibility for your education.

Most people tend to mistake education for the time that they spent in school.
Recognise that it is a process, and like all processes, it can be hacked.

###Step 2: Set ambitious goals for yourself.

The template goal sheet that your manager sends you and 20 others at the end of the financial year is not good enough.

###Step 3: The standard pace is for chumps.

The systems you see around you are designed so that anyone can keep up. Read that again, the systems you find comfort in are designed for the lowest common denominator. Don't be a chump.

Original quote is from this [blog post](https://sive.rs/kimo "The standard pace is for chumps") by Derek Sivers

###Step4: No Zero days

A viral reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/ "No zero days") spawns a movement with more than 100K subsribers. The idea, as all good ideas tend to be is simple. No more zero days. "A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros"

This means that I will do atleast one minute of whatever activity that I have deemed appropriate to bring me closer to my goals every day. No more zero days.
